Out Loud is The Andy Warhol Museum's inclusive audio guide. Learn about the life and art of pop artist Andy Warhol through different stories and a variety of voices, such as scholars, curators, and members of Warholâ€™s family. 

Out Loud is designed to be inclusive of users across abilities. For users who are blind or have low vision, the app is optimized to work with VoiceOver and Dynamic Type. The app also offers in-depth visual descriptions of Warhol artworks. At the museum, Out Loud uses bluetooth low-energy beacons to show visitors stories based on their location.
